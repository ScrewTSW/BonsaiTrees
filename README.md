# BonsaiTrees :deciduous_tree: :palm_tree: :evergreen_tree:

A Minecraft mod adding a block that grows small trees in two block spaces.

For local build, if the version of libnonymous was not updated by the original developer, you will need to build libnonymous from my fork as well
https://github.com/ScrewTSW/libnonymous/tree/1.16.4

## Changes to Bonsai Trees 1:

- Soils, Saplings and Drops are now stored as recipes (Thanks @Darkhax!)
- This and changes in 1.14.* require some changes in the old config jsons,
  which sadly means old trees are not always straight forward to port.
- Reworked the way drops are being specified and calculated
- Bonsai Pots can now get waterlogged, what happens then can be configured
  in the mod options.
- Removed multi-shape rendering of trees for performance reasons.
  Instead they are now being randomly rotated.
- Removed some of the commands that are not needed anymore
- The save tree shape command is now "/bonsai model save" and copies
  the resulting tree model json to your clipboard.
- Split off some of the code into a library mod: libnonymous
  This includes some base things I do with all my blocks, but also for
  example the MultiBlockModel renderer, thats used in both Compact
  Machines and Bonsai Trees.
- Removed Bonsai Advancements (will probably come back in a future update)
- Removed all parts of the never used API. People usually add trees via
  json files. If anyone needs a specific functionality, e.g. some event
  when a bonsai is fully grown or something please don't hesitate to ask
  or create a pull request.
- Moved build pipeline from Travis and Dropbox to be fully contained on
  github. Currently a self-hosted maven is necessary since public
  packages on github still require authentication for some reason.
